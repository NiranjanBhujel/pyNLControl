# pyNLControl

pyNLControl is the package for nonlinear control and estimation. It is python based package. Almost all of the module will be applicable to linear system as well. Some might be applicable only to nonlinear or linear only.

## Requirements
* python >= 3.6 (might work on older version of python3, not tested)
* casadi>=3.5.5 and jinja2>=3.0.2 `pip install casadi jinja2 `


## Installations

```
pip install pyNLControl
```

## Supported control and estimator
* Estimators: Kalman filter, Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter. Partical filter, moving horizon estimator, etc will be added soon.
* Control: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control will be added soon
* Misc: Nonlinear observability analysis, Noise covariance identification will be added soon

=============================

Functions
---------

    
`Gen_Code(func, filename, dir='/', mex=False, printhelp=False)`
:   Function to generate c code (casadi generated as well as interface) for casadi function.
    
    Args:
        func (casadi.Function): CasADi function for which code needs to be generated
        filename (str): Name of the generated code
        dir (str, optional): Directory where codes need to be generated. Defaults to current directory.
        mex (bool, optional): Option if mex is required. Defaults to False.
        printhelp (bool, optional): Option if information about input/output and its size are to be printed . If mex is False, sfunction help is also printed. Defaults to False.

    
`Gen_Test(headers, varsIn, sizeIn, varsOut, sizeOut, callFuncName, filename, dir='/')`
:   Generates C code with main function. This code along with code generated by `Gen_Code` function can be compiled to executable to check computation time or debug.
    It can also be used as example to compile on other target.
    
    Args:
        headers (list[str]): List of header files name along with extension .h). These files will be added in main file as #include "header".
        varsIn (list[str]): List of name of input variables.
        sizeIn (list[int]): List of size of input variables.
        varsOut (list(str)): List of name of output variables.
        sizeOut (list(int)): List of size of output variables.
        callFuncName (str): Name of the C function that needs to be called.
        filename (str): Name of the generated C file (along with extension .c).
        dir ([str], optional): Directory where code needs to be generated. Defaults to current directory.

    
`Integrate(odefun, method, Ts, x0, u0, *args)`
:   Function to integrate continuous-time ODE. It discretize the provided ODE function and gives value of state variables at next discrete time. 
    
    Args:
        odefun (function): Python function with states as first and control input as second argument. Remaining argument could be anything required by state equations
        method (str): Method to integrate ODE. Supported methods are: 'FEuler', 'rk2', 'rk3', 'ssprk3', 'rk4', 'dormandprince'.
        Ts (float): Step time to solve ODE
        x0 (float or casadi.SX or numpy.1darray): Current states of the system
        u0 (float or casadi.SX or numpy.1darray): Current control input to the system
    
    Returns:
        float or casadi.SX or numpy.1darray: Next states of the system

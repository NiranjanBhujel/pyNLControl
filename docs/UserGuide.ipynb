    "\n",
    "`pyNLCOntrol` is a package to solve general estimation and control problem (including non-linear problem). Further, it also  provides different method for analysis of dynamic system. This package is based on \\texttt{CasADi} for python ([https://web.casadi.org/](https://web.casadi.org/)). This means problem should be formulated in `CasADi`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "* python >= 3.6 (might work on older version of python3, not tested)\n",
    "* casadi>=3.5.5 and jinja2>=3.0.2 `pip install casadi jinja2`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installations\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pyNLControl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported control and estimator\n",
    "* Estimators: Kalman filter, Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and simple moving horizon estimators. Partical filter,  advanced moving horizon estimator, etc will be added soon.\n",
    "* Control: LQR only. Other controllers including nonlinear Model Predictive Control will be added soon\n",
    "* Misc: Nonlinear observability analysis, Noise covariance identification will be added soon\n",
